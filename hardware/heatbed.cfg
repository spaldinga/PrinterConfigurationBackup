[quad_gantry_level]
gantry_corners:
	-60,-10
	410,420
#   A newline separated list of X, Y coordinates describing the two
#   opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to Z,
#   the second to Z2. This parameter must be provided.
points:
	50,25
	50,275
	300,275
	300,25
#   A newline separated list of four X, Y points that should be probed
#   during a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL command. Order of the locations is
#   important, and should correspond to Z, Z1, Z2, and Z3 location in
#   order. This parameter must be provided. For maximum accuracy,
#   ensure your probe offsets are configured.
speed: 200
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
max_adjust: 10
#   Safety limit if an adjustment greater than this value is requested
#   quad_gantry_level will abort.
retries: 5
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.0175
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance.
